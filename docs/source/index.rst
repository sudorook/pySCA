=============================================================================
Statistical Coupling Analysis in Python.
=============================================================================

The Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) is an approach for characterizing the
pattern of evolutionary constraints on and between amino acid positions in a
protein family. Given a representative multiple sequence alignment of the
family, the analysis provides methods for quantitatively measuring the overall
functional constraint at each sequence position (the position-specific, or
"first-order" analysis of conservation), and for measuring and analyzing the
coupled functional constraint on all pairs of sequence positions (the
pairwise-correlated, or "second-order" analysis of conservation). The premise
is that extending the traditional definition of conservation to include
correlations between positions will contribute to defining the architecture of
functional interactions between amino acids, and more importantly, help define
the basic physical principles underlying protein structure, function, and
evolution.
